- Instructions about project are in `./project-instructions.md`. Read and follow this carefully.
- Steps you need to take are defined in `./steps.md` file. Read and follow this carefully.
- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- You have couple of other mcp servers set up, use them without my special prompt if you need information about the state of the project, or need to implement something:
  - github
  - dokploy
  - shadcn
